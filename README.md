# Sagan

**Sagan** is an F# client for [Cosmos DB](https://https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/).
It provides F# friendly types and functions to communicate with Cosmos on top of the official [Microsoft Azure CosmosDB .NET Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/).

Sagan might ditch the official library and talk directly over HTTP in the future.
